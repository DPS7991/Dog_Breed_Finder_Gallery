## Discussion

I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, and React.
I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to generate the scaffolding for the app.

## Requirements

#### The user should be able to select from all available breeds (not sub-breeds).

#### When the user selects a breed, the UI should update and display 3 random images of that dog breed.
